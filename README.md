# sgmSystem

Module generated by JHipster 6.5.1 that contains the features User Management, Product Management, Profile Management and Category Management (service's category).

>Note: For more information about JHipster 6.5.1, consult the documentation [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.5.1](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.5.1).

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

>P.s: If you dont want to install MySQL and Elasticserach in your machine, you can use it as Docker container (see "Using Docker to simplify development" in this readme)

1. [JDK 8][]: The JDK 8 is the Java development kit used for this Spring project.

2. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

3. [MySQL][]: Relational database used to store all project information.

4. [Elasticsearch][]: Elastic search allow you to make personalized queries and do powerful and fast searches.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./gradlew -x webpack
    npm start

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies. Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### PWA Support

JHipster ships with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and it's disabled by default. One of the main components of a PWA is a service worker.

The service worker initialization code is commented out by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in `src/main/webapp/index.html`:

```html
<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('./service-worker.js').then(function() {
      console.log('Service Worker Registered');
    });
  }
</script>
```

Note: [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) powers JHipster's service worker. It dynamically generates the `service-worker.js` file.

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    npm install --save --save-exact leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    npm install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
Edit [src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts](src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts) file:

```
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
```

Edit [src/main/webapp/content/scss/vendor.scss](src/main/webapp/content/scss/vendor.scss) file:

```
@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
```

Note: There are still a few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

### Using Angular CLI

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

    ng generate component my-component

will generate few files:

    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
    update src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts

    
## Deploying

![Environments](deploy/environments.jpg)

There are three environments to deploy the application (Dev, QA and Prod) and each it contains the configuration file located in [deploy/config/](deploy/config/) folder. Below are the attributes of each configuration file that must be changed to deploy the application:

config.sh
This file contains the main data to deploy the application in any environment. 

| Attribute  | Description |
|--|--|
| REMOTE_USER | User to access the repository |
| TOKEN | Token (password) to access the repository |

config.dev.sh, config.prod.sh and config.qa.sh
This file contains the data to deploy the application in a specific environment. 

| Attribute  | Description |
|--|--|
| REMOTE_SERVER_USER |  Remote server user (ex: root, ubuntu...) |
| REMOTE_SERVER_KEY | Remote server access key file name. The access key file (file in PEM format) must be in [deploy/keys/](deploy/keys/) folder  |
| REMOTE_SERVER_ADDRESS |  Server address where the application will be deployed |


To deploy the application in the specific environment, run the command:

    ./gradlew deploy -P<env>

*Change `<env>` by your desired environment (**dev**, **qa** or **prod**).*

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test integrationTest jacocoTestReport

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    npm test

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

To start all third party services in a docker container, run:

	docker-compose -f src/main/docker/dev.yml up -d

To stop them and remove the containers, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/dev.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jibDockerBuild

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.
